# Robot-Gladiators

## Description
I crafted an immersive in-browser combat simulator game known as "Robot Gladiators." In this captivating game, 
players assume the role of a coach guiding their robot through a thrilling sequence of battles. Throughout the
gameplay, participants accrue cash, bolster their robot's attack potency, and undertake vital repairs. 
The pinnacle of the game involves the preservation of a robot that secures the highest cash accumulation, 
etching their victory into the browser's storage system. The foundation of this creation rests upon the 
dynamic pairing of HTML and JavaScript technologies, delivering a seamless and captivating gaming experience.
