# Robot-Gladiators

## Description
I bult a in broweser command prompt combat simulator game called Robot Gladiators. During the game, players will coach their 
robot through a series of fightsâ€”gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way. The robot that 
survives with the most cash will be remembered in the browser's storage system! The technologys I used are HTML and javascript.
